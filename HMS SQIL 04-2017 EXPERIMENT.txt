Reproducibility can improve evidence-based methods, engage stakeholders, and promote transparency among researchers (Baker, 2016). For these reasons, this study uses open-access R and RStudio software; our actual data from the experiment, statistical inference and codes can be downloaded from GitHub at the public repository https://github.com/SAO65/HMS-SQIL-2017-EXPERIMENT, and reproduced and improved by fellow researchers.
